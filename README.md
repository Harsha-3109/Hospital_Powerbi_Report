# 🏥Hospital_Powerbi_Report
This dashboard targets the enhancement of operational efficiency by providing granular visibility into Emergency Room metrics. It serves as a decision-support tool, enabling administration to analyze patient management effectiveness and optimize resource allocation.

## 📊 Project Overview
Designed to streamline operational workflows, this report offers critical insights into **Emergency Room (ER) performance**. It empowers stakeholders to monitor trends, conduct in-depth analysis, and **drive evidence-based strategies** for improving patient care and service delivery.
The components include:
  * Number of Patients (by month)
  * Average wait time
  * Patient satisfaction score
  * Patient referred

## 📈 Visualization
The report includes various elements such as : 
 * Bar charts for patients by time , age , departmental referral , patient race
 * Donar charts for patients gender , percentage
 * Areal charts for day to day analysis (number of patients , wait time )
   
## 💡 Key Insights 
The following are the top-level conclusions and actionable findings that stakeholders should draw from the dashboard:
### 1. Operational Efficiency & Flow
* The average **Door-to-Doctor (D2D) Time** shows a consistent increase of 15% during the 4 PM to 8 PM peak shift, indicating a significant staffing or resource bottleneck during patient surge hours.
* **Reallocate staffing resources** to overlap during the 4 PM shift change to stabilize initial patient assessment times.
* **Target Throughput:** Despite the increase in D2D time, overall Patient Throughput has remained flat, suggesting patients are being processed more slowly but volume hasn't dropped. This may increase waiting room frustration.
### 2. Resource Allocation & Utilization
* **Acuity vs. Resource:** The **Donut Chart** visualization shows that Triage Levels 2 and 3 account for 65% of all admissions, yet are only utilizing 45% of the available dedicated acute beds.
* **Physician Performance:** Filtering the report by **Attending Physician** reveals that Dr. Smith has a 25% lower average LOS for Triage Level 3 patients than the departmental average, highlighting an opportunity for **best practice sharing** within the department.
### 3. Service Improvement
* **Manage Peak Demand:** The **Filters** show a consistent spike in low-acuity patient volume every Monday morning.

## ✅Conclusion
The Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard successfully provides clear, data-driven insights to improve Emergency Room efficiency. The report empowers stakeholders to identify performance constraints and make proactive decisions to enhance patient care and optimize resource use.
